# Linked List Implementation in Java

This Java class defines a basic linked list data structure with various methods for manipulating the list. The class is encapsulated within the `linked.list` package.

## Class Structure

### Node Class

The `LinkedList` class contains an inner class named `Node`. This inner class represents the individual nodes of the linked list. Each node contains an integer value (`val`) and a reference to the next node (`next`). The constructor of the `Node` class initializes the node with a given value.

### Linked List Class

The main `LinkedList` class is responsible for managing the linked list. It has the following attributes:

- `head`: A reference to the first node (head) of the linked list.
- `tail`: A reference to the last node (tail) of the linked list.

### Methods

1. **isEmpty()**: This private method checks whether the linked list is empty by examining whether the `head` is null. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is empty.

2. **insert(int val)**: This method inserts a new node with the given value at the beginning of the linked list. If the list is empty, both `head` and `tail` are set to the new node.

3. **Includes(int val)**: This method searches for a node with the given value in the linked list. It traverses through the list and returns `true` if the value is found, otherwise `false`.

4. **append(int val)**: This method appends a new node with the given value to the end of the linked list. If the list is empty, it simply calls the `insert()` method.

5. **insertBefore(int val, int newVal)**: This method inserts a new node with `newVal` before the node with the value `val`. It first checks if the value exists in the list. If it does, it handles special cases for inserting at the beginning and then traverses the list to find the node before which the new node should be inserted.

6. **insertAfter(int val, int newVal)**: Similar to the `insertBefore()` method, this method inserts a new node with `newVal` after the node with the value `val`. It also checks for the existence of the value, handles cases for inserting after the tail, and traverses the list to find the appropriate position.

7. **toString()**: This overridden method provides a string representation of the linked list. It constructs a string by traversing through the nodes and appending their values, separated by "->". If the list is empty, it returns a message indicating the emptiness.

## Usage

This `LinkedList` class offers methods to perform common operations on a linked list, such as insertion at the beginning, end, before a specific value, and after a specific value. It also provides a readable string representation of the linked list. To use this class, create an instance of it and call its methods as needed to manipulate the linked list.

Keep in mind that this implementation is a simplified version of a linked list and might not cover all edge cases or optimizations that can be implemented in a real-world scenario.
